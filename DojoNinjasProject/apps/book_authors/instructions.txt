1. Change the name of the 5th book to C#
    b = Book.objects.get(id=5)
    b.name = "#"
    b.save()

2. Change the first_name of the 5th author to Ketul
    a = Author.objects.get(id=5)
    a.first_name = "Ketul"
    a.save()

3. Assign the first author to the first 2 books:
e.g. 
    book = Book.objects.get(id=1)
    author = Author.objects.get(id=1)
    book.authors.add(author)

4. Assign the second author to the first 3 books

Speed it up:
    firstThree = Book.objects.filter(id__lt = 4)
    author = Author.objects.get(id=2)
    for book in firstThree:
        book.authors.add(author)

5. Assign the third author to the first 4 books

    ...

6. Assign the fourth author to the first 5 books (or in other words, all the books)
    author = Author.objects.get(id=4)
    for book in Book.objects.all():
        book.authors.add(author)

7. For the 3rd book, retrieve all the authors
    book3 = Book.objects.get(id=3)
    book3.authors.all()

8. For the 3rd book, remove the first author

    author = Author.objects.get(id=1)
    book3 = Book.objects.get(id=3)
    book3.authors.remove(author)

9. For the 2nd book, add the 5th author as one of the authors

    book2 = Book.objects.get(id=2)
    book2.authors.add(Author.objects.get(id=5))

10. Find all the books that the 3rd author is part of

    author3 = Author.objects.get(id=3)
    author3.books.all()

11. Find all the books that the 2nd author is part of

    author2 = Author.objects.get(id=3)
    author2.books.all()
